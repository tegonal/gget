# gget

g(it)get is a bash based script which pulls a file or a directory stored in a git repository.
It includes automatic verification via GPG signature.  
It enables that files can be maintained at a single places and pulled into multiple projects (e.g. scripts, config files etc.)
In this sense, gget is a bit like a package manager which is based on git repositories but without dependency resolution and such.

<details>
<summary>The initial idea behind this project:</summary>

You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well 
(as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts)).
This tool provides an easy way to fetch them into your project.

Likewise, you can use gget to pull config files, templates etc. which you use in multiple projects but want to maintain 
at a single place.
